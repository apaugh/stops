# stops
Stops is a simple transit application for Ubuntu Touch. It allows you to add stops to a list by stop id and provides bus estimates.

Due to the simplicy of Stops, it is easy to add support for new transit networks. Contributors simply need to add a new .js file for their network and implement two methods. Details can be found under Stops/backends/Readme.txt.

Currently supports: 
- Translink (Vancouver, BC)
- SoundTransit (Seattle, WA)
- Metro (Seattle, WA)

## Future plans
Planned features for Stops include:
- Displaying stops on a map.
- Nearby stop lookup using GPS.
